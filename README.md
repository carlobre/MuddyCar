The muddyland team invites you to know the PROJECT OF HIGH ENERGY EFFICIENCY VEHICLE

In this project we took a few years, in the successive courses, we have been introducing improvements and new developments, in terms of design and motorization.

The vehicle is being built by adapting it to the regulations of Shell Eco-marathon, an annual competition, for experimental vehicles and Concept Urban, which have a high energy efficiency. Our intention is to be able to participate in this competition.

In order to carry out this project, we have the human resources of teachers and students, very excited about the project, as well as the facilities and equipment of our Center, but, for the acquisition of all the necessary materials, to carry out the project, we need companies that want to sponsor us.

If we consider our project of interest and can sponsor, we are at your disposal, both the Director of the Center and the Project Coordinator, for any information or clarification requested by us
